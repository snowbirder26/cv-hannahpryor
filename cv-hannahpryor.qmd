#### CAREER OBJECTIVES

*Research and education in ornithology and evolutionary biology*

My primary areas of interest are hybridization, speciation, and bioacoustics. I am particularly curious about the role of song and song learning in passerine hybrid zones, and how this can facilitate or inhibit the speciation process.
